  "description": "github action for creation and registration of aws instances as github actions self-hosted runners.\nthis action is a fork of [machulav/ec2-github-runner](https://github.com/machulav/ec2-github-runner).\nit has been modified to:\n  - support image (ami) search patterns and owners rather than a specific ami id. useful if, for example, the latest ubuntu image is required.\n  - bootstrap the image by installing docker and git if they are not preinstalled.\n  - support overriding user-data when custom dependencies need to be preinstalled.\n  -- setting of the aws region with the ec2-region input rather than an environment variable.\n  - support use of the default subnet and security group for the vpc/az instead of requiring an explicit security group and subnet.\n  - support use of spot or scheduled instances as opposed to only scheduled instances.",
